#Hint
#You are given a string word that consists of digits and lowercase English letters.
#
#You will replace every non-digit character with a space. For example, "a123bc34d8ef34" will become " 123  34 8  34". Notice that you are left with some integers that are separated by at least one space: "123", "34", "8", and "34".
#
#Return the number of different integers after performing the replacement operations on word.
#
#Two integers are considered different if their decimal representations without any leading zeros are different.
#Example 1:
#
#Input: word = "a123bc34d8ef34"
#Output: 3
#Explanation: The three different integers are "123", "34", and "8". Notice that "34" is only counted once.
#Example 2:
#
#Input: word = "leet1234code234"
#Output: 2
#Example 3:
#
#Input: word = "a1b01c001"
#Output: 1
#Explanation: The three integers "1", "01", and "001" all represent the same integer because
#the leading zeros are ignored when comparing their decimal values.
# 
#
#Constraints:
#
#1 <= word.length <= 1000
#word consists of digits and lowercase English letters.
