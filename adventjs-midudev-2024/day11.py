# 🏴‍☠️ Filenames encoded
# The Grinch has hacked 🏴‍☠️ Santa Claus's workshop systems and has encoded the names of all the important files. Now the elves can't find 
# the original files and they need your help to decipher the names.
# Each file follows this format:
# It starts with a number (can contain any number of digits).
# Then has an underscore _.
# Continues with a file name and its extension.
# Ends with an extra extension at the end (which we don't need).
# Keep in mind that the file names may contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), other underscores (_), and hyphens (-).
# Your task is to implement a function that receives a string with the name of an encoded file 
# and returns only the important part: the file name and its extension.
# Examples:
# 
# decodeFilename("2023122512345678_sleighDesign.png.grinchwa");
# // ➞ "sleighDesign.png"
# 
# decodeFilename("42_chimney_dimensions.pdf.hack2023");
# // ➞ "chimney_dimensions.pdf"
# 
# decodeFilename("987654321_elf-roster.csv.tempfile");
# // ➞ "elf-roster.csv"
